                    We are two French students, Bastien and Nathan coming from ESAIP to a semester abroad, 6 months, 
                    at the Riga Technical University in Latvia. We study computer science for 3 years.

                    Currently, we are in flat share with two German girls. 
                    We live in the downtown of Riga, twenty minutes far from the school by bus.
